Approach:
Deep learning siamese network which tries to find the similarity between the two input images.
Resnet50 has been used for feature extraction
and the output is passed through a classifier, which classifies into same or different.

Training :
Training is done on spot-the-difference dataset
Half the datset contains similar images and the other half contains different images.
custom input pipeline had to be built to input two comparing images to the network.
the target value has been set to "0.0" for different images and 1.0 for similar images.
The training was done for 500 epochs and a loss of ~0.2 was reached.

Inference:
for the purpose of visualising the difference between the images, initially a deep learning based
approach known as grad-cam was used. This apporch calculates the gradients in reverse to determine
what should be the input, if the generated output is this. Sadly, this approach did not work (or required
more time for implementation). Finally a simple Opencv approach had to be used.
